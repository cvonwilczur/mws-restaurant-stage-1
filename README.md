## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

1. Clone or download this repo to your local machine.

2. Navigate in Terminal to the root folder of the app, and from there, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.  

In a terminal, if you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and browse the app.
